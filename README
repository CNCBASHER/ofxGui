Original author: Stefan Kirch/stiwi, alphakanal.de
Modifications (as far as as I can tell) by simongeilfus,andyli,bilderbuchi

This source version is based on andyli's version, adapted for OF0061, from http://www.openframeworks.cc/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=461&start=105.


Comments:
The new switch element is included and working in the GUI, and reports events to the console. I'm not sure if the implementation via dummy_Tags is optimal, though.
