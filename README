ofxGui, a simple GUI addon for openFrameworks

licensed under the GPL license (as per stiwi's wish)
Original author: Stefan Kirch/stiwi, alphakanal.de
Modifications (as far as as I can tell) by simongeilfus,andyli,bilderbuchi

This source version is based on andyli's version, adapted of OF0061, from http://www.openframeworks.cc/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=461&start=105.

The new switch element is included and working in the GUI, but events etc is not working (no updates in the console, e.g.)
